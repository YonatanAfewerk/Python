#   2. Write a program that reads two integers (in any order) and then print either “multiple” or “not” according to
    weather one of the integer is multiple of other.

#   4. Write a program that takes two numbers from user and determines that first number is a factor of second
    number
     
#   5. Write a program that mimics a calculator. The program should take as input two integers and the operation
    to be performed. It should then output the numbers, the operator, and the result. (For division, if the
    denominator is zero, output an appropriate message.) Use 1 for Addition, 2 for Subtraction, 3 for Multiplication,
    and 4 for Division.

#   6. Write a program that calculate the real roots of a quadratic equation and displays the result.
        
#   7. Write a program to display the first 100 odd numbers
          
#   8. Write for, do-while, and while statements to compute the following sums and products.
           
#   9. A prime number is an integer greater than one and divisible only by itself and one. The first seven prime
    numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and 17. Write a program that displays all the prime numbers between 1 and 100. 
    
#   10. Write a C++ program that counts the number of digits in an integer number. For example; 23,498 has five
    digits
    
       
#   11. Write a C++ application that can compute the letter grade of a student after accepting the student’s mid and
        final mark. The program should only accept mid result [0-40] and final [0- 60]. If the data entered violates this
        rule, the program should display that the user should enter the mark in the specified range. The program is also
        expected to run until the user refuses to continue. 

#   12. Write a C++ program that accepts a positive number from the user and displays the factorial of that number.
    Use for loops to find the factorial of the number. 
   
#   13. write a program in C++ to read a number n and a single digit d. The program then determines whether the
        digit presents in the number or not. If it presents the program should determine how many times it appear and
        the position of the digit in the number 

#   14. Using the ASCII table numbers, write a program to print the following output, using a nested for loop. (Hint:
        the outer loop should loop from 1 to 5, and the inner loop’s start variable should be 65, the value of ASCII “A”). 
   
#   15. Write a C++ program that will print the following shapes  
        A.

#   16. A program to generate Fibonacci series. The first two digits in the series are 0 and 1 and the rest is
