#   1. Write a float function triangle() that computes the area of a triangle using its two formal parameters h and w,
        where h is the height and w is the length of the bases of the triangle. 
    
#   2. Write a float function rectangle() that computes and returns the area of a rectangle using its two float formal
    parameters h and w, where h is the height and w is the width of the rectangle 
        float rectangle(float h, float w)
      
#   3. The formula for a line is normally given as y = mx + b. Write a function Line() that expects three float
    parameters, a slop m, a y-intercept b, and an x-coordinate x. the function computes the y-coordinate associated
    with the line specified by m and b at x-coordinate. 

#   4. Write a program that accepts a positive integer from the user and displays the factorial of the given number.
    You should use a recursive function called factorial () to calculate the factorial of the number. 

#   5. Develop a program that uses the function factorial () of exercise 4 to compute an approximation of e (Euler’s
        number). Base your approximation on the following formula for e: 1 + 1/1! + 1/2! + 1/3! + … 


#   6. Write a function called isPrime() that accepts a number and determine whether 
        the number is prime or not. 

#   7. Write a function called isEven() that uses the remainder operator(%) to determine whether an integer is even
        or not
