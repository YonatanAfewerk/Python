#   1. Write a program to store the ages of six of your friends in a single array. Store each of the six ages using the
        assignment operator. print the ages on the screen 
            
 

#   2. Write a C++ program that accepts 10 integers from the user and finally displays the smallest value and the
    largest value. 
        


#   3. Write a program that accepts ten different integers from the user and display these numbers after sorting
    them in increasing order. 
  

#   4. Write a program to store six of your friend’s ages in a single array. Assign the ages in a random order. print
the ages, from low to high, on-screen 


#   5. Write a C++ program that calculates the letter grades of 20 students. The program should accept the mid
result and the final result from the students. Use the appropriate validity control mechanism to prevent wrong
inputs. 


#   6. Write a C++ program that has two functions toBinary and toDecimal. The program should display a menu
prompting the user to enter his choice. If the user selects toBinary, then the function should accept a number in
base ten and displays the equivalent binary representation. The reverse should be done if the user selects
toDecimal. 


#   7. Write a C++ program that accepts a word from the user and then displays the word after reversing it. */


#   8. Develop a C++ program that accepts the name of a person and then counts how many vowels the person’s
name have. 


#   9. Write a program in C++ which read a three digit number and generate all the possible permutation of
numbers using the above digits. For example n = 123 then the permutations are: 123, 213, 312, 132, 231,
321 


#   10. Write a program which read a set of lines until you enter #. 


#   11. Write a program which read two matrix's and then print a matrix which is addition of these two matrix's. 12.
Write a program which reads two matrix and multiply them if possible 


#   13. Write a program which reads a 3×2 matrix and then calculates the sum of each row and store that in a one
dimension array
